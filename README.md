# ECG-acquisition-classification
Single Lead ECG signal Acquisition and Arrhythmia Classification using Deep Learning

This project contain two parts,

1. ECG signal Acquasition

2. Arrhythmia classification of the acquired ECG signal.

## Files

- [`ecg`](ecg) : This folder contains all the files for training and testing of the deep learning algorithm and this code will be used to classifiy the acquired signals.

- [`arduino`](arduino) : Aurdino code for the 4th order Notch filter, displaying ECG signal in computer, calculating instantanious BPM, etc.
